# Bitter
A fully functional and slightly watered-down twitter-like website made for a school assignment. Features most of the functionality you'd expect to see on twitter, for example posting, liking, replying and real-time chatting. Made using Flask, Jinja, MySQL and SocketIO.

> Naturally there's more performance optimizations to be made, however most of these would only matter for a large scale platform. If this project ever became a large scale platform I imagine there would be greater concerns than something like packaging and serializing data, as opposed to sending JSON, when fetching posts.
